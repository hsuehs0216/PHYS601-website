Initially with the goal of playing hockey, my time in Canada has been a roller coaster ride in both personal and academic path. My undergraduate journey was no different and I eventually found my passion in physics and astronomy. At the University of British Columbia (UBC), I spent my first two years as a nutrition major before being accpeted in the combined honours program of physics and astronomy, and subsequently graduated with a bachelor degree in science in May 2024.</p> <p>Currently, I am a Master's student working with Dr. Tracy Webb at the Trottier Space Institute (TSI) at McGill University with a research focus on Extragalactic Astronomy. More specfically, I am studying a group of Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs) at redshift between 0.2 - 1.2, then interpreting their properties through different astrostatistics techniques and coming up with explanation of how they fit into the bigger picture that is galaxy evolution and their environmental impact with other previous studied BCGs.</p>"},{"location":"about/#previous-experiences","title":"Previous Experiences","text":"<p>The last two years of undergraduate and research experience blueprinted out my area of research interests for the current Master's project. I truly believe that these experiences have helped me down the academic path and shaped my mindset towards scientific research. A more detailed information for each experiences can be found in the Projects page.</p> <p>I attended a summer student program in 2022 with National Centre for Theoretical Science (NCTS) in Taipei, Taiwan with Dr. Ellis R Owen where we tackled the impact of cosmic rays on circumgalactic gas dynamics. In the following school year, I completed my honour thesis at UBC with Dr. Jess McIver alongside the Gravitiational Wave astrophysics group which I worked on an extension for a machine learning algorithm called GSpyNetTree for categorizing overlapping Compact Binary Coalescence Signals. </p> <p>The summer of 2023 took me to Gothenburg,Sweden for a fellowship with Chalmers Astrophysics &amp; Space Sciences Summer (CASSUM) program. I was working with Dr. Jonanthan C. Tan and Dr. Maya A. Petkova where we did a case study on \"The Brick\" in the Centre Molecular Zone of Milky Way and explored the kinematic properties of identified structures using dendrograms. </p> <p>In my final school year, I was working with Dr. Allison Man where we explored the properties of Quiescent Galaxies at redshift ~ 2. More specifically, we wanted to understand the overall dust and molecular gas mass of these massive galaxies, and compared the results with their spectral profile data. Our goal was to come up with an explanation on their quenching mechanisms as it has been an interesting topic within the extragalactic astronomy for the past decades.</p>"},{"location":"about/#other-interests-and-activities","title":"Other Interests and Activities","text":"<p>Since joining the McGill community, I have been involved with outreach activities such as public talks.

The centres of galaxy clusters are among the most violent yet least understood regions of the universe, at all redshifts. Their complex nature - which includes the physics of large-scale gas cooling, star formation (SF), Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback, and galaxy mergers and interactions - make them key laboratories for hierarchical processes of structure growth. A cluster core contains several important components. Sitting at the bottom of the gravitational potential well of most clusters is a single massive galaxy, known as the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG). BCGs are highly uniform in properties such as luminosity, metallicity and surface brightness profile, and are distinct from the general galaxy population. They are surrounded by a hot Intracluster Medium (ICM) which, in the absence of AGN heating, may cool into the centre.</p>"},{"location":"reasearch/#why-do-we-study-them","title":"Why do we study them?","text":"<p>The formation and evolution of BCG and its ICM throughout cosmic time is not fully understood, and it has been puzzling the astronomers for many years. Star formation in the BCGs has thought to be in-situ beyond a redshift value of 0.2. At lower redshift, the correlation bewtween the star formation rate and cooling time in some clusters indicates that BCGs are fed by large scale gas cooling, but this is very rare. As we go to higher redshift, however, the correlation becomes less clear. To understand this relation better becomes the main drive of this project.</p>"},{"location":"reasearch/#observation-data-from-alma-and-project-objective","title":"Observation Data from ALMA and Project Objective","text":"<p>In this project, My supervisor Dr. Tracy Webb has gathered a total of 33 BCGs with spectroscopic redshift spanning between 0.2 and 1.2 using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) where the targets are observed in several different spectral windows. These unresolved observation of the CO(2-1) line for these new BCGs coupling with the previous population enable us to measure the total molecular gas reservoir within the central galaxies of young clusters. We aim to systematically expand the existing molecular gas studies of high redshift BCGs with ALMA, and facilitate the first statistical study of gas deposition onto BCGs, and its relation to the stellar mass growth of these important systems. From this, we hope to employ constraints to construct a narrative of BCG stellar mass growth.</p>"},{"location":"reasearch/#related-studies-and-papers","title":"Related Studies and Papers","text":"<p>These are some of the related studies for the my research since I have no publications as of now:</p> <ul> <li>Previous BCG CO Statistical Analysis</li> <li>SpARCS1049+56 - high SFR Galaxy Cluster</li> </ul>"},{"location":"reasearch/all_publications/","title":"Publications","text":""},{"location":"reasearch/all_publications/#2023","title":"2023","text":"<ul> <li>The effect of lactose intolerance on future lunar exploration.
